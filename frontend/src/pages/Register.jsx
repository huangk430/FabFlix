/**
 * useUser():
 * <br>
 * This is a hook we will use to keep track of our accessToken and
 * refreshToken given to use when the user calls "login".
 * <br>
 * For now, it is not being used, but we recommend setting the two tokens
 * here to the tokens you get when the user completes the login call (once
 * you are in the .then() function after calling login)
 * <br>
 * These have logic inside them to make sure the accessToken and
 * refreshToken are saved into the local storage of the web browser
 * allowing you to keep values alive even when the user leaves the website
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * useForm()
 * <br>
 * This is a library that helps us with gathering input values from our
 * users.
 * <br>
 * Whenever we make a html component that takes a value (<input>, <select>,
 * ect) we call this function in this way:
 * <pre>
 *     {...register("email")}
 * </pre>
 * Notice that we have "{}" with a function call that has "..." before it.
 * This is just a way to take all the stuff that is returned by register
 * and <i>distribute</i> it as attributes for our components. Do not worry
 * too much about the specifics of it, if you would like you can read up
 * more about it on "react-hook-form"'s documentation:
 * <br>
 * <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/">React Hook Form</a>.
 * <br>
 * Their documentation is very detailed and goes into all of these functions
 * with great examples. But to keep things simple: Whenever we have a html with
 * input we will use that function with the name associated with that input,
 * and when we want to get the value in that input we call:
 * <pre>
 * getValue("email")
 * </pre>
 * <br>
 * To Execute some function when the user asks we use:
 * <pre>
 *     handleSubmit(ourFunctionToExecute)
 * </pre>
 * This wraps our function and does some "pre-checks" before (This is useful if
 * you want to do some input validation, more of that in their documentation)
